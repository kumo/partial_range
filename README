PartialRange
============

PartialRange is a simple parser that can convert an array of numbers into a string (e.g. from [1,2,3,5] into "1-3,5") or turn a string into an array of numbers (e.g. from "1,2,1,2-3" into [1,2,3]).

I think that I once wrote this code to help me understand if I was missing episodes from an anime. From a list of filenames I would extract the episode numbers and then see if any were missing.

From what I remember it does work, however it is rather clumsy and works in a non-standard way, so that 'PartialRange.parse_to_string([1,2,3])' must be written instead of something like 'PartialRange.new([1,2,3]).to_s'.


Example
=======

PartialRange.parse_to_string([1,2,3,5,6,10,11,12,13,8])
 -> 1-3,5-6,8,10-13
